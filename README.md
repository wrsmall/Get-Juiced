  <h3>The Muse<h3/>
   As the world begins the transition into the era of electric vehicles, my team and I set out to simplify the process of finding a charge port in an area unknown to the user. Get Juiced allows users to comfortably travel without worrying about the stress of finding a charge port when their vehicle needs to be charged.
